<h2>Importing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To import aweslib into your DiamondFire plot, first go to the **Code Vault** (you can get to that plot by going to spawn, holding the Emerald/Game Menu item and typing "Code Vault". The correct one is made by *trashoflevillage*).</li>
  <li>When you are on the Code Vault plot, type "@AwesomeSoundLib" in chat and press the Enter key. This will show a menu with found templates, click on the one that says "Made by SirObby_" and press the diamond "Grab" item.</li>
  <li>Now you have the template in your inventory, save it to one of your toolbars and exit Code Vault.</li>
  <li>Go onto your plot, then type **/dev** to enter dev mode.</li>
  <li>Place down the function you got from Code Vault.</li>
  <li>Open the chest above the new FUNCTION block that was placed, grab "aweslib:trigger" and "aweslib:song" and place the two functions down.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Making a Song</h2>
<i>Make sure you have imported aweslib first!</i>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new function named "song" (it can be anything you want it to be) and put a SET VARIABLE block in it.</li>
  <li>Right click the SET VARIABLE block, and change it to a "Create List" SET VARIABLE.</li>
  <li>Name the new local List variable "aweslib:notes"</li>
  <li>Using the generator on this site, click "New" and choose instrument + pitch, then generate it after.</li>
  <li>After generating your tune, copy the text it shows you and paste it into the "aweslib:notes" list as a text variable</li>
  <li>Call your song function then "aweslib:song", and see if it works!</li>
</ol>
