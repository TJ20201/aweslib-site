aweslib is a library on [DiamondFire](https://mcdiamondfire.com) made by [SirObby_](https://github.com/SirObby).
## Importing
  1. To import aweslib into your DiamondFire plot, first go to the **Code Vault** (you can get to that plot by going to spawn, holding the Emerald/Game Menu item and typing "Code Vault". The correct one is made by *trashoflevillage*).
  2. When you are on the Code Vault plot, type "@AwesomeSoundLib" in chat and press the Enter key. This will show a menu with found templates, click on the one that says "Made by SirObby_" and press the diamond "Grab" item.
  3. Now you have the template in your inventory, save it to one of your toolbars and exit Code Vault.
  4. Go onto your plot, then type **/dev** to enter dev mode.
  5. Place down the function you got from Code Vault.
  6. Open the chest above the new FUNCTION block that was placed, grab "aweslib:trigger" and "aweslib:song" and place the two functions down.
## Making a Song
*Make sure you have imported aweslib first!*
  1. Create a new function named "song" (it can be anything you want it to be) and put a SET VARIABLE block in it.
  2. Right click the SET VARIABLE block, and change it to a "Create List" SET VARIABLE.
  3. Name the new local List variable "aweslib:notes"
  4. Using the generator on this site, click "New" and choose instrument + pitch, then generate it after.
  5. After generating your tune, copy the text it shows you and paste it into the "aweslib:notes" list as a text variable
  6. Call your song function then "aweslib:song", and see if it works!
